For the testing dataset, we collected a table of region vs covid case percentage (more to see in the percent_data folder) under the table
covid_percent. This is a total of 177 data entries (each for a region in New York) in the table that will be paired with other data collected
in the same region. Specifically, we are interested in the topic of ridership per week vs. the covid percentage (1) in each region and
the median income in household vs. the covid percentage (2) in each region. For both topics, a continuous chi-square (2-way ANOVA) test is conducted
on them to see if they are independent or not.
